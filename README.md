## Key Informations about this repo
- This repo hosts my profesionnal website.
- This website was built with Gatbsy, a static site generator using React and GraphQL.
- I use Formium to handle form creation and submissions for the contact form.
- The blog is written in Markdown and sourced locally (no CMS) as it's currently no use to get more complicated than that.
