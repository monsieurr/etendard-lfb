## Keeping Everything Organized

As a person (yes), a developper and someone that has a huge collection of photos it's crucial for me to keep everything organized.
Today I want to share with you some tools I use to keep everything organized.
This will be more focused on the dev side of things, think "Keeping Everything Organized as a Programmer", I'll probably make another article
on my other website 

### Notion



### Alternatives

It's important for me to go through some alternatives as even if I currently use Notion I used and tried other services that might fit you more.
I'll try to go from the simplest solution to the more complex (kind of, it's not easy to define that).

- A pen an paper
- Notepad
- Google Sheets/Google Docs
- Evernote
- Obsidian
