Well my first answer would logically be, content is coming very soon I have a lot of ideas I just need to write it down
in a well organized and consise manner.
This is part of the answer but not entirelly!
Today I want to go over what I want this blog part to be and what it will take for me to write the first "real" post on it, let's go


## First an idea



## Then a project

### Making the project


### Taking notes
This would almost be the draft of the article



## Finally putting it all together

### Making it sound and clean


### Adding images and interactions


### Publishing
